We succesfully managed to get a working version of the demo game, it is not perfect but, the features of the working version include 
- Creation of a lobby or joining a pre-existing one
- Remembering users name and tracking their total kills
- Support for 4 people per match over the internet
- Player control, shooting, death and respawning
- Per team scoring system to determine winner
- UI for game menu to leave match and in game scoreboard
