# Background Info
Game demo done during an internship with four other students. Internship which lasted 4 months was part of curriculum in vocational school and final grade for this project was 4.5 out of 5. Jobs were divided as follows, two programmers, two artists and map designer/sound. Common tasks for everyone included teamwork, weekly reports and project planning. Specific tasks I completed include: Player movement, shooting, balls and their physics , scoring system, UI, multiplayer and team system.
 
# Project Premise
Idea for the game was a team based multiplayer battler over the internet. Players are assigned one of two teams, robots or aliens. These teams battle trying hit an enemy after bouncing the ball atleast one time for an arena- or player placed wall. Every time you hit an enemy your personal score increases and gets added to the teams score. You earn more score based on how many times the ball has bounced before hitting an enemy. Winner is the team with more score after timer runs out.
# End result
We succesfully managed to get a working version of the demo game, it is not perfect but, the features of the working version include 
- Creation of a lobby or joining a pre-existing one
- Remembering users name and tracking their total kills
- Support for 4 people per match over the internet
- Player control, shooting, death and respawning
- Per team scoring system to determine winner
- UI for game menu to leave match and in game scoreboard
- Character animations and ball trails

Some features we are missing include
- Maps, only one map made was added to the map selection
- Graphics and settings
- Player placed walls
